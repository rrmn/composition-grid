# Composition Grid
Composition Grid is a free open source browser extension that lets you analyze website layouts instantly with composition grids.

You can toggle between 
- **Golden Ratio** (Phi) Grid
- **Rule of Thirds** Grid

and **change the color of the grid** by entering a HEX code or CSS color name (e.g. `#00FF00` or `purple`).

Free, open source, and works on any website. Built for designers,  developers, and product managers who value precision.

# Something not working? Ideas for features?

If you have ideas, questions: Just [open an issue](https://github.com/rrmn/composition-grid/issues/new/choose) here on Github.

Your requests are being heard! I recently added the ability to set a different grid color based on a Google Review.
